# DiNho Optimizer — Agent Instructions

## Project Overview

DiNho Optimizer is an Electron desktop application for Windows system optimization, built with TypeScript, React, and Electron Vite. It provides system cleaning, registry optimization, malware scanning, privacy protection, driver management, and more.

## Tech Stack

- **Runtime:** Electron (main + renderer process)
- **Language:** TypeScript (strict mode)
- **UI:** React + Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui
- **Build:** Electron Vite
- **State:** Zustand
- **Testing:** Vitest + Playwright (E2E)
- **Package Manager:** npm

## Core Principles

1. **Test-Driven** — Write tests before implementation, 80%+ coverage required
2. **Security-First** — Validate all inputs, sanitize paths, never mutate
3. **Immutability** — Create new objects, never mutate existing state
4. **Agent-First** — Delegate complex tasks to specialized agents
5. **Plan Before Execute** — Plan complex features before writing code

## Agent Orchestration

Use agents proactively without explicit user prompt:
- Complex feature requests → **planner**
- Code just written/modified → **code-reviewer**
- Bug fix or new feature → **tdd-guide**
- Architectural decision → **architect**
- Security-sensitive code → **security-reviewer**
- Build/type errors → **build-error-resolver**
- E2E critical flows → **e2e-runner**

Use parallel execution for independent operations.

## Security Guidelines

**Before ANY commit:**
- No hardcoded secrets (API keys, passwords, tokens)
- All user inputs validated
- SQL injection prevention (parameterized queries)
- XSS prevention (sanitized HTML)
- CSRF protection enabled
- Error messages don't leak sensitive data

**If security issue found:** STOP → use security-reviewer agent → fix CRITICAL issues

## Coding Style

- Many small files over few large ones (200–400 lines typical, 800 max)
- Functions small (<50 lines), files focused (<800 lines)
- No deep nesting (>4 levels)
- Proper error handling — never silently swallow errors
- File organization by feature/domain, not by type

## Testing Requirements

**Minimum coverage: 80%**
- Unit tests — individual functions, utilities
- Integration tests — IPC handlers, stores
- E2E tests — critical user flows

## Git Workflow

Commit format: `<type>: <description>` — Types: feat, fix, refactor, docs, test, chore, perf

## Lint Status (2026-06-13)

- `noExplicitAny`: **error** (enabled Jun 13, 2026) — all violations cleaned up:
  - 6 `catch (err: any)` → `catch (err: unknown)` in production IPC handlers
  - 1 `app.on(... as any)` → `as never` in `src/main/index.ts`
  - All test file instances suppressed via `// biome-ignore lint/suspicious/noExplicitAny`
- `noConsoleLog`: **error** — all violations in main process replaced with `getLogger()`
- Pre-existing: 476 lint errors remain (primarily `noBannedTypes`/`Function` in test files)
